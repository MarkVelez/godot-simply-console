# Simply Console for Godot 4

Simply Console is an in-game console window focused on being usable by players not just the developer.

## Usage

Since the console is made to be accessible by players, it does not have the ability to execute arbitrary pieces of code. Instead, custom commands are used to execute existing methods from any object inside of the game.

The console can also be directly printed to to display errors, warnings or general messages.

## Planned features

- Command scene restriction
- Command hints and suggestion
- In-Game object picker to get references
